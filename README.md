If a transgender person hasn't changed their name legally, they see their dead name everywhere they go. True Self allows you to substitute your dead name with your chosen name on any web page you visit. Or you can test
out a new name! Just type your dead name in the 'Given Name' field and your new
name in the 'True Self' field. Then click apply. Welcome home! You are your
True Self!

I wrote this on behalf of my son. We got tired of seeing his dead name on school stuff before we changed it. It is written entirely in plain JavaScript. You will never be tracked and usage is completely anonymous.
